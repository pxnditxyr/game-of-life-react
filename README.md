# Project Game of Life | React Typescript

This project is an implementation of the Game of Life using React and Typescript.

The Game of Life is a cellular automaton developed by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It is a zero-player game, which means that its evolution is determined by its initial state and does not require any further input. The "board" of the game is a two-dimensional grid of cells that can be in one of two possible states: "alive" or "dead". The cells evolve according to a set of simple rules that depend on the state of their neighboring cells.

## Installation

To install the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pxnditxyr/game-of-life-react.git
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    cd game-of-life-react
    npm i
    ```

3. Start the application:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Usage

Once the application is started, you can interact with the Game of Life using the mouse. Click on the cells to change their state and press the "Start" button to begin the simulation.
